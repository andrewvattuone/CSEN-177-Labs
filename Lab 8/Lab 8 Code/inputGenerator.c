/*Description:
    Generates 10000 random numbers between 0-14, which represents 10000 page requests for pages with page numbers between
    0 and 14. Each number is written to the testInput.txt file and is written on its own line, which makes reading each
    request easier. testInput.txt is used in the first part of the script.sh test to see if the 3 page replacement algorithms
    behave properly
