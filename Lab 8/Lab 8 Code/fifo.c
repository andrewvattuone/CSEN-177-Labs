/*Description:
    Reads page requests from an input file and either searches for or adds them to a cache. If a page isn't found in 
    the cache, a FIFO page replacement algorithm is used to select the oldest page added to the cache, select it as a victim,
    and swap it with the newly requested page. Total page faults are recorded and printed out afterward. Size of cache is
    passed in by the user.
