/*Description:
    Reads page requests from an input file and either searches for or adds them to a cache. If a page isn't found in 
    the cache, an LRU page replacement algorithm is used to find the least recently used page (the one that hasn't been 
    accessed by a request in the longest period of time), select it as a victim, and swap it with the newly requested 
    page. Total page faults are recorded and printed out afterward. Size of cache is passed in by the user.
