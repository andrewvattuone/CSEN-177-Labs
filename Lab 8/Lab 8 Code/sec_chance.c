/*Description:
    Reads page requests from an input file and either searches for or adds them to a cache. If a page isn't found in 
    the cache, a Second Chance page replacement algorithm is used to find a victim page by selecting a page with its pageHit
    value equal to 0. Since a pageHit value is set to 1 whenever the page is accessed, a page therefore will only be selected
    if the algorithm passes over it twice without the page being accessed by a request, so it's as if each page was given a
    "second chance." The victim page is then swapped out with the newly requested page. Total page faults are recorded and 
    printed out afterward. Size of cache is passed in by the user.
