/*Description: 
    Generates 2 matrices, and then computes their product. Matrix A is an NxM matrix and matrix B is an MxL matrix. The 
    entries in matrix A and matrix b are all randomly generated integers between 0 and 9. The product wil be an NxL 
    matrix, called matrix C. Separate threads are created to calculate each row of C, which theoretically would allow for the 
    parallel computation of each row since each row thread would run at the same time, which would speed up runtime 
    (we only have single-core CPUs though so it won't have much of an impact). The individual entries of C are calculated
    using conventional matrix multiplication rules. Since the directions said to make each matrix 256x256 I did it, but
    the output is too large to see on the terminal window, so change all matrices to 2x2 matrices if you want to see all
    the values of A and B and the product matrix C.
