//Title: Lab5 â€“ Synchronization using semaphores, locks, and condition variables - Step 3
/*Description:
    Implementation of the consumer-producer problem using semaphores. Producer produces 10 integer messages (0-9) and sends
    them to a buffer, which the consumer reads from and prints out. One message is printed at a time and one message is consumed
    at a time. After creating each producer and consumer thread, the main thread sleeps for 1 second before creating the next
    2 threads. To solve problems with the critical section, several semaphores are used to make sure that only one producer or
    consumer can access the critical section at a time, that the producer can only access the critical seciton if there's at least
    one open slot in the buffer to insert messages into, and that the consumer can only access the critical seciton if there's 
    at least 1 message inside the buffer that can be removed.

//Shared data: semaphores called "full", "empty", and "lock"
//Buffer to hold n items
//"lock" provides mutual exclusion to the buffer pool
//"empty" and "full" count the number of empty and full slots in the buffer
//Initially: full = 0, empty = n, lock = 1
//Producer thread
