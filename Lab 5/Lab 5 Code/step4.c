//Title: Lab5 â€“ Synchronization using semaphores, locks, and condition variables - Step 4
/*Description:
    Implementation of the consumer-producer problem using semaphores. Producer produces 10 integer messages (0-9) and sends
    them to a buffer, which the consumer reads from and prints out. One message is printed at a time and one message is consumed
    at a time. After creating each producer and consumer thread, the main thread sleeps for 1 second before creating the next
    2 threads. To solve problems with the critical section, a mutex lock is used to make sure that only one producer or consumer 
    can access the critical section at a time, a conditional variable and a while loop is used to make sure that the producer can only access the 
    critical seciton if there's at least one open slot in the buffer to insert messages into, and another conditional variable
    and a while loop makes sure that the consumer can only access the critical seciton if there's at least 1 message inside the buffer that 
    can be removed.
