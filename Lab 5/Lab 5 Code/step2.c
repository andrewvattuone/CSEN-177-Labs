/*Description:
    Creates 10 threads, each with an index 0-9. Each thread runs a function that prints out "Thread (thread index) Entered
    Critical Section", and then sleeps for 1 second before continuing. The main thread waits for all 10 threads to terminate 
    before continuing, and after each thread terminates it prints out "Thread (thread index) termianted." A mutex lock is
    used to prevent multiple threads from printing out their "Thread Entered Critical Section" statements at the same time,
    which prevents race conditions that could otherwise cause the incorrect index to be printed.
