/*Description:
    Creates several threads, and each one reads 1 byte sizeof(buffer) times from a file at a time, and stores it in a 
    buffer. The number of threads is determined by command line input. Immediately afterward it writes the bytes stored 
    in buffer into a new file. Buffer size is still determined by command line input. Later on the time it takes to do 
    this is calculated using the time terminal command.
